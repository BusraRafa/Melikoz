**Customer Responsibility**

Returned products are your responsibility until they arrive at DECIEM.

Though it’s not required, we do recommend purchasing tracking services for your protection and to also hold on to the proof of postage in case you need to contact us about your return. Only products received by our warehouse can be credited.

If we cannot locate your order number, we are unable to process the refund. We encourage you to be mindful of what is being sent to us as any products incorrectly sent back cannot be credited and will not be sent back to you.

DECIEM does not incur the cost of return tracking or postage.
