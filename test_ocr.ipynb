A full moon occurs when the Moon is on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun, so the Sun's light reflects off the Moon's surface and is visible from Earth. This happens once every lunar month, which is about 29.5 days. During a full moon, the Moon appears fully illuminated. I should mention the phases leading up to it, like the waning gibbous and then the full moon. Also, maybe note that it's when the Moon is farthest from Earth in its orbit, but wait, no, the full moon is actually when it's at apogee or perigee? Wait, no, the distance varies, but the full moon's visibility is more about the alignment. Maybe I should focus on the basic explanation without getting too technical. Keep it simple and concise. Make sure to highlight the alignment, the illumination, and the frequency. Avoid any unnecessary details. Let me check if I got the phases right.

      "Shopify **does not handle shipping or logistics directly**—it is the **merchants** (store owners) who manage shipping, inventory, and delivery. Whether shipping to **Bangladesh** is possible depends on the **merchant’s shipping policies** and **logistics providers** they use. Here’s how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Merchant Responsibility**\n",
      "   - Merchants on Shopify can ship to **Bangladesh** if they:\n",
      "     - Offer **international shipping**.\n",
      "     - Partner with **logistics companies** that deliver to Bangladesh (e.g., DHL, FedEx, Aramex, or local couriers like BD Express, Grameen Phone, or Naptol).\n",
      "     - Have **proper customs documentation** and comply with **import regulations** for Bangladesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Shopify’s Role**\n",
      "   - Shopify provides **tools for merchants** to manage shipping, track orders, and integrate with third-party logistics providers.\n",
      "   - It does **not guarantee** shipping to Bangladesh or handle delivery logistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Challenges for Bangladesh**\n",
      "   - Shipping to Bangladesh may involve **customs delays**, **higher shipping costs**, and **logistical complexities** due to the country’s geography and infrastructure.\n",
      "   - Merchants must ensure compliance with **Bangladeshi import laws** (e.g., product restrictions, duties, and taxes).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **How to Check**\n",
      "   - Look for **shipping options** on the product page (e.g., \"Ship to Bangladesh\").\n",
      "   - Contact the merchant directly to confirm **availability** and **delivery timelines**.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re a buyer, always verify with the seller before purchasing. If you’re a merchant, Shopify’s **Shipping & Fulfillment tools** can help manage international orders. Let me know if you need guidance on either role! 😊\n",

      "The ability to **return a parcel** and the **conditions** for returns depend on the **merchant’s return policy**, not Shopify itself. Shopify provides tools for merchants to manage returns, but **return policies are set by individual sellers**. Here’s what you need to know:\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 📦 **General Return Conditions (Merchant-Defined):**\n",
      "1. **Timeframe**:\n",
      "   - Most merchants allow returns within **14–30 days** of delivery, but this varies.\n",
      "   - Check the **product page** or **order confirmation email** for specific details.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Eligibility**:\n",
      "   - Items must be **unused** and in **original condition** (e.g., tags intact, packaging undamaged).\n",
      "   - Some merchants may **exclude sale items, custom orders, or perishable goods**.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Refund Method**:\n",
      "   - Refunds are typically issued to the **original payment method** (e.g., credit card, PayPal).\n",
      "   - Some sellers may offer **store credit** or **exchanges** instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Shipping Responsibility**:\n",
      "   - Merchants may require you to **cover return shipping costs** or offer **free returns**.\n",
      "   - Check the **return instructions** provided by the seller.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Customs or Import Restrictions**:\n",
      "   - If the item was shipped to **Bangladesh**, additional **customs duties or import taxes** may apply, and the seller may not refund these fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 🛠️ **How to Initiate a Return:**\n",
      "1. **Contact the Merchant**:\n",
      "   - Use the **contact form**, **chat**, or **email** provided in the order confirmation.\n",
      "   - Request a **return authorization** or **refund**.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Follow Instructions**:\n",
      "   - Ship the item back using the **prepaid label** (if provided) or your own shipping method.\n",
      "   - Keep **proof of shipping** (e.g., tracking number).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Wait for Processing**:\n",
      "   - Merchants typically process refunds within **5–10 business days** after receiving the returned item.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 📌 **Shopify’s Role**:\n",
      "- Shopify does **not enforce return policies**; it only provides a **platform** for merchants to manage returns.\n",
      "- Merchants can use Shopify’s **Return Management tools** to streamline the process (e.g., tracking returns, issuing refunds).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### ✅ **What to Do If You’re Unsure**:\n",
      "- Check the **product page** for return policies.\n",
      "- Look for **FAQs** or **contact information** in your order confirmation email.\n",
      "- Reach out to the **merchant directly** for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
